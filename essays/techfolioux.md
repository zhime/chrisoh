TechFolio presents an excellent opportunity for me to develop a desktop applications because of its practical use case and guaranteed audience. Web and mobile development have largely been my focus as an undergrad. But desktop applications aren't going anywhere, and they're still much more capable than browsers for serious tasks. 

While starting the binary release of TechFolio Designer, I found it burdensome to constantly go back to the menu bar to continue the initialization process. Some of the steps were also unintuitive and I would've taken much longer to proceed without referring to the TFD website. 

A short term fix for the above solution could be adding directions in the Command Logs, or having a button or clickable region in the blank areas of the table (similar to an input field) so users don't have to go back to the menu bar. But a better fix would be for all the steps to happen automatically without having to click or do anything unless an input is required.  

Another improvement could be having mark down related features as buttons at the top of the essay editor or visual elements like red wavy underlines under mispelt words. While using the built in TechFolio editor is convenient, it doesn't make the process of creating and editing markdown documents any easier than a stock text editor would. I also found it impossible to copy and paste in the built in editor but I'm sure that wasn't an intentional feature.
